Windows Phone 7 Turnstile Control for Silverlight
=================================================

A [ListBox](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.listbox\(v=vs.95\).aspx) control for Windows Phone 7 with built in support for the Turnstile effect (similar to the one used by Windows Phone 7 when you select to launch an app from the phone's start homepage).

This code was inspired by the [Windows Phone 7 Turnstile Control for Silverlight](http://turnstile.codeplex.com) by [Roberto Sonnino](http://virtualdreams.com.br/blog) with support from [Alex Sorokoletov](http://sorokoletov.com/2011/02/wp7-turnstile-and-tilt-effects/) who added basic support to Roberto's work  for scroll scenarios (when the Turnstile control is placed directly in scrollviewer). 

To read more on how the basics of Turnstile control works and the wereabouts behind it, take a look at [this article from The Code Project](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/117360/Windows-Phone-7-Turnstile-Control-for-Silverlight)
