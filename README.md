Windows Phone 7 Turnstile Control for Silverlight
=================================================

This control is an ItemsControl for Silverlight that allows you to recreate the Turnstile effect from Windows Phone 7 in your applications.

This code is a fork from [Windows Phone 7 Turnstile Control for Silverlight](http://turnstile.codeplex.com) by [Roberto Sonnino](http://virtualdreams.com.br/blog) merged with a patch created by [Alex Sorokoletov](http://sorokoletov.com/2011/02/wp7-turnstile-and-tilt-effects/) that adds supportsfor in-scrollviewer scenarios (when Turnstile control is placed directly in scrollviewer). 

To read more on how the Turnstile control works and the wereabouts behind it, take a look at [this article from The Code Project](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/117360/Windows-Phone-7-Turnstile-Control-for-Silverlight)

This repository also has Silverlight demos of the functionality (both from Roberto and Alex).

**Note:** To run the demos you need [Silverlight 4 Control Tookit](http://silverlight.codeplex.com/releases/view/43528)
